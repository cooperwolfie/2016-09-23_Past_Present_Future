<h1> Cheyenne's Past, Present, and Future </h1>
<section>
  <img class="right" src="Brooklyn-Bridge-(New-York,-USA).jpg">
<h2> My Past </h2>
  <p> I was born in Brooklyn, New York in Brooklyn Hospital in 2000. I live there for at least 6 years.
    During those 5 years, my mom and dad were a bit on edge since 9/11 happened. In result from that, we moved to Ware Shoals, South Carolina-- to find peace of mind. </p>

  <p> Living in Ware Shoals for about one year, I had my first exotic pet, an Iguana named Harry. Harry was a trouble-maker; he liked to play with the bathroom tissues and pop birthday balloons.
    When I turned 7, I had my second exotic pet, Mr. Fuzzy, a non-venomous tarantula. I only had him for a year before donating him to a local zoo because we had to move to a new house in
    Greenwood, and the residents there didn't appreciate "creepy crawly friends". </p>
  </section>
    <p>We lived in Greenwood for 4 more years. After that my dad grew tired of driving 45 minutes from Greenwood to Greenville, so our (and his) solution to that is to move to Greenville.</p>

      <p>When we moved, I attended Beck Academy 7th through 8th grade. And then to J.L Mann, from 9th to 10th grade. In the summer of 2015, I adopted my third pet, a ginger tabby named Tiger! He was originally named Carrot,
      but with different family and friend decisions, he now has three names; Carrot, Tiger, and Cheddar. He is a very friendly cat that made friends with the next door neighbor kitten, Spooky! And Tiger also has weird behavior; he acts like a dog. He plays fetch with you and he likes his belly being rubbed. </p>

<h2> Present </h2>
<img class="left" src="greenville-school-041.jpg">
<p> I am now 16 years old and currently still living in Greenville and attending J.L Mann High School. Tiger is now a year (and a few months) old. I only live with my mom and dad now,  but soon I have to leave the nest and prepare myself for college. I have two nephews and a niece. My half brother is getting married soon! I told him when, but he says he doesn't know.</p>

    <p>I am boggling my brain about what and where I want to be in the future. I have an interest in astronomy, programming and the visual arts. And I don't know how I can mix the three together to make a perfect sandwich. I have a few idols that give me inspiration. Like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPor7cJ9udb6BT1TUWiJflw"> sarehkee </a>.</p>

 <p>I went to a college fair and got several ideas about where I want to go, but I'm still deciding. There was a school here that showed what they are about and I am considering if I want to go there... college hunting is so difficult.</p>

 <h2> Future </h2>
<p>To be honest, I am a little scared of the future. I don't know how I can fulfill all of my interests at once.  It seems that I have to ditch one in order to fulfill another.  But I do want to become an animator, game developer, and concept artist for games. The part about astronomy... I guess studying the stars will be a hobby, and maybe I can use it as an idea holder... but right now, I view of the future and where I want to end up is fuzzy.</p>
<h3> Bucket List </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Meet some of my favorite Youtubers/gamers </li>
  <li> Travel somewhere international </li>
  <li> Learn and speak another language (Especially Japanese)
